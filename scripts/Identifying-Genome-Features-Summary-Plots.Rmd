```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

In this script, I'll create summary tables and figures for genome feature identification of various CpG categories. I'll also run statistical analyses to determine if distributions differ between these datasets.

### Import line counts

```{r}

PactDMCGeneOverlaps <- PactDMCGeneOverlaps[-3,] #Remove final row
tail(PactDMCGeneOverlaps) #Confirm import
```

```{r}
PactDMCCDSOverlaps <- read.table("../analyses/Identifying-genomic-locations/Pact/Pact-DMC-data-paCDS-counts.txt", header = FALSE, col.names = c("counts", "filename")) #Import file with all file-CDS overlaps
PactDMCCDSOverlaps <- PactDMCCDSOverlaps[-3,] #Remove final row
tail(PactDMCCDSOverlaps) #Confirm import
```

```{r}

### Create summary tables

```

```{r}
PactDMCFeatureOverlapsPercents <- PactDMCFeatureOverlaps[-1,] #Remove gene overlap information and save as a new dataframe
for (i in 1:length(PactDMCFeatureOverlapsPercents)) {
  PactDMCFeatureOverlapsPercents[,i] <- (PactDMCFeatureOverlapsPercents[,i] / sum(PactDMCFeatureOverlapsPercents[,i])) * 100
} #Calculate percentages

### Create plot

        ylim = c(0, 115)) #Create base plot. Everything should be white. Do not plot axes. Include sequencing type as labels and set size. Set y-axis specs.

axis(side = 2, at = seq(0, 100, by = 10), las = 2, col = "grey80", cex.axis = 1.2) #Add y-axis
mtext(side = 2, "Proportion CpGs", line = 3, cex = 1.5) #Add y-axis label
